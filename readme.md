# My Intro-Web-Dev-Homework-Repo
## Quinn Bruderer


My reasons for taking this class are...
* **The Credit of course**.

    1. Its required.
    1. I want to graduate.
    1. For understanding JavaScript, it is awkward to not understand CSS.

* **Learn Markdown Better**.

    * So I can make more **_visually friendly_** documentation

* **Understand the freelance process**
    * I don't want Wix to run me out of a potential job.

## InterNET and WorldWideWEB

1. I did learn that the web address is a human friendly way to select which IP address to get information from.

2. And as the request is routed back and forth, multiple addresses are "shelled"? (Need a better word) to help the information navigate to and from the correct computers/servers.
